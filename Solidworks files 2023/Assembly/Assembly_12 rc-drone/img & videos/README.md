## **1. Complaint Letter Draft (To AICTE / University / College Principal)**

**To:**
The Principal / University Ombudsman / AICTE Grievance Cell
\[Your College Name]
\[College Address]

**Subject:** *Formal Complaint Regarding Harassment, Threats, and Suppression of Academic Freedom*

**Respected Sir/Madam,**

I, **Akashdip Mahapatra**, a student of **B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering (Registration No: 211690100710009 OF 2021-22)**, wish to lodge a formal grievance regarding repeated instances of intimidation, mental harassment, and coercion by members of the Mechanical Engineering department, particularly involving **Mr. Niloy Ghosh (HOD)** and associated faculty.

In **November 2023**, I was called to the HOD’s room regarding educational videos I had posted on my YouTube channel. These videos were created solely for academic purposes to help my peers better understand mechanical concepts using FreeCAD and 3D modeling. The content was based on publicly available machine drawings and general lab equipment, with no sensitive college information disclosed. Despite this, I was shouted at, threatened with exam cancellation, and forced to bring my mother to college. Under duress, I was made to sign an apology note (copy attached), fearing I would be barred from appearing in university labs or final exams.

Again in **2025**, when I published another educational video explaining 3D printing, I was called in and threatened for merely using a common college facility (3D printer), which other students also use freely. I was told to take down the video and was again harassed. During one such instance in 2023, I was shouted at inside the HOD’s office in front of other faculty members, and my friend, \[Friend’s Full Name], was present outside and can confirm the incident.

This ongoing harassment and pressure violate the AICTE's Code of Conduct for faculty and my fundamental right to education and expression under **Article 19(1)(a)** of the Constitution. The college staff's actions have caused immense psychological stress and disrupted my academic progress.

**I request the following:**

1. A formal inquiry into the conduct of the HOD and involved faculty.
2. Protection from any future harassment or academic threats.
3. Recognition of my academic content creation as a positive initiative, not a punishable offense.

Please find attached:

* Email from the HOD dated 23.11.2023
* Copy of the forced apology letter
* Link to my educational YouTube video [FreeCad](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_RecMEcs_p-64eGvpN2eosIKdT6n4L7h), [`Meteorology` & `Manufacturing process` lab](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_RecMEcs_p-EuVk0-JudqSREmGBtP2TF), 2025 audio record for recent `Drone` [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/ONkDHn3DzHc?feature=share)
* Witness statement by my friend

Thank you for considering my request seriously. I am confident that you will take appropriate action in the interest of justice and student welfare.

Sincerely,</br>
**Akashdip Mahapatra** </br>

**Witness Statement**

I, **Suman Maji**, student of **Mechanical Engineering, 2025 batch**, hereby provide this statement in relation to the incident involving Mr. Akashdip Mahapatra and the Head of Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mr. Niloy Ghosh.

On the date of the incident (around **November 2023**), I was present near the HOD’s office when Akashdip Mahapatra was called in. I personally heard loud voices and shouting coming from inside the room and saw other faculty members enter during the incident. After the meeting, Akashdip appeared visibly distressed and informed me of the threats made against his right to appear in final exams unless he removed certain educational videos from YouTube.

I am providing this statement voluntarily as a witness to support the truth of what happened and confirm the nature of the harassment faced by my fellow student.
